I am trying to paste text or URL into text blocks or sticky notes and nothing happens. I donâ€™t receive any error message, its just blank.I tried using keyboard shortcut methods. the right click method to copy/paste URLs or text, restarting Miro and resizing the screen to 100% but not successfully. Seems like a bug because I used to be able to do this. Hope it can be fixed soon and please let me know what I can do to make this happen again.
